Description: l10n package for generation of OSM based maps from PostGIS
 localisation package  for generation of OSM based maps from PostGIS.
 This is currently used in german mapnik style but can be used in a
 renderer independant way because ist is based on PostgreSQL stored
 procedures. This includes a transliteration function based on
 ICU any-latin, a kanji transcription library based on
 libkakasi and a couple of pl/pgSQL funktions.
